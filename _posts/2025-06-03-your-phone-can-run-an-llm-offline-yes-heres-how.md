Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are no longer confined to powerful cloud data centers. The frontier of AI is rapidly expanding to the “edge” — to devices like smartphones, smart cameras, industrial sensors, embedded systems, and more. Deploying AI models directly onto these resource-constrained devices opens up incredible possibilities: real-time processing, enhanced privacy, offline functionality, and reduced latency.

However, bridging the gap between developing AI models and successfully running them on diverse edge hardware can be a challenging task. It requires understanding model optimization, hardware acceleration, specific SDKs, and deployment workflows.

This is where the **Google AI Edge Gallery** comes in.
