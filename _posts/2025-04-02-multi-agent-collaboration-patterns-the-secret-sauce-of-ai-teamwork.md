### Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns: The Secret Sauce of AI Teamwork

### When One AI Isn’t Enough

We’ve seen how multi-agent RAG systems outperform solo agents — but how do these AI teams actually _work together_ effectively? The magic lies in their collaboration patterns. Just like human teams, AI agents need:

✅ Clear communication protocols  
✅ Defined roles and responsibilities  
✅ Conflict resolution mechanisms  
✅ Performance feedback loops

Let’s explore the **five most powerful collaboration patterns** that transform individual agents into unstoppable AI teams.

### How It Works

  * Multiple agents generate independent responses
  * A moderator agent evaluates and synthesizes the best parts

    def debate_style(query):    
        # Generate diverse perspectives    
        optimistic = optimist_agent.run(f"Positive aspects of {query}")    
        pessimistic = pessimist_agent.run(f"Risks of {query}")    
        neutral = neutral_agent.run(query)    
          
        # Synthesize    
        return moderator.run(    
            f"Create balanced answer combining:\n"    
            f"Optimistic: {optimistic}\n"    
            f"Pessimistic: {pessimistic}\n"    
            f"Neutral: {neutral}"    
        )

 **Best for:** Controversial topics, risk assessment, strategic planning
