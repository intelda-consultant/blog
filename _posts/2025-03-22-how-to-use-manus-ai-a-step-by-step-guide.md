### How to Use Manus AI: A Step-by-Step Guide

What if an autonomous AI agent could plan your trips, crunch data, or build websites while you relax? Meet Manus AI, a game-changing productivity AI tool from Monica, a Chinese startup, launched on March 6, 2025. Unlike typical chatbots, this autonomous AI executes real-world tasks with minimal input, earning buzz as “China’s second DeepSeek moment.” I’ve crafted this step-by-step guide to help you master AI task automation with Manus. Let’s dive into this productivity powerhouse.

### What Makes Manus AI Stand Out?

Manus isn’t here to talk — it’s here to _work_. This cloud-based, multi-agent system takes your ideas, breaks them into steps, and uses tools like web browsers and code editors to deliver polished results. This autonomous AI agent bridges intent and action, from travel itineraries to stock dashboards. Built on models like Claude and Qwen, it’s in private beta, blending promise with a few quirks. Here’s how to tap into its AI task automation magic.

### Step 1: Secure Your Invite to the Autonomous AI Party

Manus is exclusive for now. Head to manus.im, click “Get Started,” then “Apply for Access.” Submit your email (Google or Apple works best) and a use case — like “I need AI task automation for my side hustle.” Be specific to stand out. Your invitation code arrives via email once approved.

 **Important Note:** Once you’re in, you’ll get **two free tries** to test Manus’s capabilities. After that, you’ll be prompted to pay for additional requests. Use your free tries wisely — think of tasks that showcase the AI’s potential, like planning a trip or analyzing data.

### Step 2: Explore the Dashboard

Log in at [manus.im](https://manus.im) with your code, and you’ll find a sleek UI with a task input box, a history pane, and an “Attachment” feature. It’s a productivity AI tool with a chatbot-like feel, supercharged for action. Please take a moment to get familiar with it.

At the top of the Manus dashboard, you’ll find a personalized greeting — _“Hello ____!”_ — that makes the interface feel welcoming and tailored to the user. A prominent **task input box** directly below this invites you to start with the prompt: _“What can I do for you? Give Manus a task to work on…”_ This is where users type their requests, whether it’s _“Plan a 2-week Canada trip”_ or _“Analyze Tesla’s stock performance,”_ serving as the launchpad for all AI task automation. Adjacent to the input box is the **“Create a new task to get started”** button, which opens a more detailed interface for crafting complex requests. Below the input box, a row of **task categories** — such as _Featured, Research, Life, Data Analysis, Education, Productivity,_ and _WTF_ — offers curated examples and inspiration, helping users quickly find ideas or templates for their tasks. In the top-right corner, the **Replay button** (likely represented by a circular arrow icon) stands out as a unique feature, allowing users to watch how Manus completes tasks step-by-step, offering transparency into the AI’s workflow. The dashboard’s clean, minimalist design, with ample white space and a focus on the task input box, emphasizes functionality and ease of use, making it clear that Manus is all about action and efficiency.

### Step 3: Assign a Task to Your Productivity AI Tool

Type a clear prompt in the task box. Try: “Build a 2-week Canada trip itinerary with flights, hotels, and a daily schedule, saved as a PDF.” Include:

  *  **Goal** : What you want (e.g., itinerary).
  *  **Details** : Context (e.g., 2 weeks, Canada).
  *  **Specs** : Must-haves (e.g., flights, hotels).
  *  **Format** : Output style (e.g., PDF).

Hit “Submit,” and watch this autonomous AI agent spring into action.

### Step 4: Peek at the Process

The “Replay” feature lets you observe Manus at work—searching flights, booking hotels, and formatting files—in real time. It’s a sandboxed glimpse of AI task automation. Step in if it falters, or marvel at the process.

### Step 5: Grab Your Results

When done, Manus delivers via the dashboard or email. For that Canada trip, expect a PDF with schedules, costs, and links. Check it—beta hiccups, like missing details, might sneak in. Are you satisfied? Awesome. Need tweaks? Refine your prompt and resubmit.

### Step 6: Master Prompt Precision

This productivity AI tool thrives on clarity. If the itinerary is too long, refine it: “Please include cultural sites in Ontario and British Columbia along with their opening hours.” Iterate and the results will become sharper. It’s a dance of precision and payoff.

### Step 7: Push the Limits

Feeling confident? Scale up. Ask Manus to “analyze Google’s stock performance over the past year and create a dashboard site” or “generate a 10-slide climate change presentation.” For complex tasks, split them — “analyze data,” then “build the site” — to keep this autonomous AI agent on track.

### Step 8: Automate and Chill

Manus runs asynchronously in the cloud. You can submit a task like “Draft a competitor analysis report,” log off, and return to a finished product. It’s AI task automation that respects your schedule.

### What to Expect in Beta

Beta life isn’t perfect. Manus can hit snags: slower response times during peak use, occasional errors (like misinterpreting prompts), or mid-task crashes. Server lag might delay outputs, and results may need a polish. Got feedback? Report bugs via the dashboard’s “Support” link or email [support@manus.im](mailto:support@manus.im) — your input helps this productivity AI tool evolve.

### Bonus Tips for AI Productivity

  *  **Stay Inspired** : Explore the “Use Case Gallery” on [manus.im](https://manus.im) for ideas.
  *  **Beta Caution** : Skip sensitive data until privacy policies firm up.
  *  **Roll with It** : Embrace glitches as part of the autonomous AI agent’s growth.

### Why Manus Matters

Manus AI previews a world where productivity AI tools handle the heavy lifting, freeing us for creativity. It’s not flawless — beta limitations keep it grounded — but it’s a bold step in AI task automation. Whether you’re a busy founder or a curious explorer, this autonomous AI agent is worth a try.
