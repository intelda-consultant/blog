Two years ago, Elon Musk signed an open letter urging a six-month pause on training AI systems more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-4, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.” Now, in a move some might call ironic, his AI venture, xAI, has released Grok 4, a model he claims could invent new technologies by year’s end and discover new physics within two years. In the rapidly accelerating landscape of artificial intelligence, moments of true paradigm shifts are rare. Yet, the recent unveiling of Grok 4 by XAI, spearheaded by Elon Musk, appears to be a pivotal event. As a computer science scholar, I’ve keenly followed the advancements in large language models and AI reasoning, and the claims made about Grok 4 are nothing short of astounding. This article delves into the announced features of Grok 4, examines its performance against rigorous benchmarks, and offers a critical perspective on its implications for the future of AI and human-computer interaction.
