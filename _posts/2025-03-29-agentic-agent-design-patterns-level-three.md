### Agentic Agent Design Patterns — Level Three

### Self-Improving Agents: AI That Learns From Its Mistakes

### The Next Frontier in Agentic Design

We’ve explored [**ReAct agents**](https://medium.com/@swengcrunch/agentic-design-patterns-3af27ef4c2d9) that reason and act, as well as [**Agentic RAG**](https://medium.com/@swengcrunch/agentic-design-patterns-level-2-d1111e6f26f5) systems that dynamically optimize retrieval. Now, let’s examine the most exciting frontier in agentic design: **self-improving agents** — AI systems that analyze their own performance, identify weaknesses, and autonomously refine their behaviour over time.

Imagine an AI assistant that:

  * Detects when its answers are unclear and rewrites them
  * Recognizes recurring knowledge gaps and schedules research
  * Identifies inefficient workflows and optimizes its own processes

This isn’t science fiction. With modern frameworks, we can build agents that **self-critique, self-train, and self-optimize**. Here’s how.
