### AI Is Flooding Classrooms — Will It Make Students Smarter or More Efficient Cheaters?

Today, every tech company scrambles to claim a slice of the educational sector. Students in higher ed can already take advantage of offers like a two-month free trial of ChatGPT Plus. A new player has entered the scene — Anthropic, the team behind the AI model Claude, has launched a tailored solution for academia: **“Claude for Education.”** As someone who’s been quite impressed by Claude’s current capabilities (though the AI landscape is shifting fast!), I believe this move deserves attention.

Anthropic articulates its mission plainly: it wants to empower academic institutions to  
**“ _develop and implement AI-enabled approaches across teaching, learning, and administration — ensuring educators and students play a key role in actively shaping AI’s role in society._ ”**

But you might be wondering: isn’t Claude already out there? It is — available in both free and paid formats. So what distinguishes **_Claude for Education_**? The answer lies in a standout capability called **“ _Learning mode_ ,”** which functions within stored conversation “Projects.” Its value proposition is one that educators confronting the rise of AI tools should seriously consider. Rather than simply delivering solutions, this feature is described as enabling students to **“ _develop critical thinking skills_ ”** by **“ _guiding [their] reasoning process rather than providing answers.”_**

In our AI-saturated era, the ability to think critically, question effectively, and assess information independently has become vital. This new Learning mode leans into a Socratic method. According to Anthropic, it prompts students with questions like **“ _What evidence supports your conclusion?_ ”** to help deepen comprehension. It also highlights foundational **“ _core concepts_ ”** and offers **“ _useful templates_ ”** to help write research papers and build study tools.
