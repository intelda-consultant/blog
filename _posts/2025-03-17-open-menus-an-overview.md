In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, the demand for powerful, flexible, and accessible AI systems has never been greater. Enter **OpenManus** , an open-source project that aims to replicate the groundbreaking capabilities of the **Manus AI agent** , a general-purpose AI developed by Monica. Manus has set a new standard for autonomous task execution, outperforming even advanced models like GPT-4 on the **GAIA benchmark**. OpenManus brings these capabilities to the open-source community, offering a modular, containerized framework built with **Docker** , **Python** , and **JavaScript**.

This project is not just a replication of Manus AI— it’s a community-driven effort to democratize advanced AI and empower developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to build, deploy, and experiment with autonomous multi-agent systems. Whether you’re planning a trip, analyzing stock markets, or generating content, OpenManus provides the tools and flexibility to tackle complex tasks easily.
