### 5 Excel Tricks That Make Your AI Models Smarter

#### Handling tables, formulas, and formatting Excel data for AI with Python and Pandas.

In our previous explorations, “[Converting Unstructured Data into LLM-Ready Formats](https://medium.com/techthync/converting-unstructured-data-into-llm-ready-formats-a-guide-with-gitingest-and-docling-f35de7127979)” and “[How I Automated PDF Data Extraction for AI in 30 Minutes](https://medium.com/techthync/a-deep-dive-into-mastering-pdf-data-extraction-with-python-35ea17e24caa),” I tackled the challenges of preparing code repositories and notoriously tricky PDFs for Large Language Models (LLMs). I saw how tools like Gitingest, Docling, PyMuPDF, and OCR libraries are essential for transforming unstructured or presentation-focused data into clean, usable formats.

But what about the ubiquitous spreadsheet? Excel files (.xlsx) are the workhorses of business analysis, data collection, and reporting. While seemingly more structured than a free-form PDF, they present unique challenges when preparing data for LLM consumption. How do we handle multiple sheets, extract specific tables, deal with hidden formulas, and convert complex grids into something an LLM can readily understand and reason about?

This guide extends the data preparation toolkit, focusing specifically on extracting and formatting data from XLSX files using Python, primarily leveraging the power of the **Pandas** library, and discussing how this fits into the broader LLM data pipeline.
