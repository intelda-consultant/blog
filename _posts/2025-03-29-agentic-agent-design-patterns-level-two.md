### Agentic Agent Design Patterns — Level Two

###  _Supercharging Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Autonomous Agents_

### Introduction

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has revolutionized how AI systems access and utilize external knowledge. But what happens when we combine RAG with [**agentic design patterns**](https://medium.com/@swengcrunch/agentic-design-patterns-3af27ef4c2d9)? The result is **Agentic RAG** — a dynamic system that doesn’t just retrieve and generate answers but actively _plans, reasons, and refines_ its approach to deliver superior results.

In this article, we’ll explore how to build an Agentic RAG system using LangChain, OpenAI, and a vector database, empowering your AI to intelligently retrieve, evaluate, and synthesize information like never before.
