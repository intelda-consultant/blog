Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini, LLaMA, Mistral, and others have revolutionized AI's ability to generate text, answer questions, and perform complex reasoning tasks. However, their massive size — often requiring high-end GPUs, substantial memory (RAM/VRAM), and significant disk space — makes them difficult to run locally or deploy cost-effectively.

 **Quantization** is the key technique that makes these models more accessible by reducing their computational and memory footprint while preserving most of their performance.
