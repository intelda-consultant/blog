### Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model with Unsloth.ai: A Step-by-Step Guide

Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming how we interact with technology, but fine-tuning is often necessary to harness their power for specific tasks. In this article, we’ll walk through the process of setting up a working environment, loading a model and tokenizer using Unsloth.ai, testing it with zero-shot inference, preparing a dataset, fine-tuning the model, performing inference post-training, and finally saving the results locally and to the Hugging Face Hub. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this guide will help you get started with practical LLM fine-tuning.

Let’s jump right in!
