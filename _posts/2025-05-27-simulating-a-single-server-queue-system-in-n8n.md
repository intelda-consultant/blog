### **Simulating a Single-Server Queue System in n8n**

#### A Low-Code Approach

Queue management systems are fundamental in countless real-world scenarios — from managing customer support calls and controlling cloud computing tasks to optimizing logistics and hospital waiting rooms. Understanding how these systems behave under varying loads is crucial for performance optimization. But simulating them often requires diving into complex programming libraries or specialized software.

What if you could build a basic queue simulation with a low-code tool? Enter n8n, the workflow automation platform that allows us to visually model a fundamental single-server queue (M/M/1) using its nodes. This approach provides a quick, intuitive way to see queue dynamics in action without writing extensive simulation code from scratch.

In this article, we’ll walk through building a simplified M/M/1 queue simulation in n8n, covering:  
✔ **Generating Job Arrivals:** Simulating random arrivals based on a Poisson process (M).  
✔ **Implementing a FIFO Queue:** Managing jobs in a First-In, First-Out structure (M).  
✔ **Modeling Service Times:** Simulating random service times based on an Exponential distribution (1).  
✔ **Processing and Logging:** Handling jobs, simulating service, and recording key performance metrics like wait times and queue lengths.
