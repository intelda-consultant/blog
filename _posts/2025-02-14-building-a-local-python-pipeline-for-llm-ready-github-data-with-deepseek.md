### Building a Local Python Pipeline for LLM-Ready GitHub Data with Deepseek

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have transformed how we interact with text data. But what if you want to keep things local? By combining Ollama with a local Deepseek model, you can build a Python pipeline to fetch, preprocess, and convert GitHub repositories into LLM-friendly text — all without leaving your machine.

The proposed approach has several advantages, such as ensuring data privacy, eliminating reliance on external APIs, and providing complete control over model interactions. Furthermore, leveraging a local LLM enhances performance for tasks like code summarization, documentation generation, and knowledge extraction, making it an ideal solution for developers and researchers working with proprietary or sensitive data.

In this article, I’ll show you how to build a Python pipeline that:

  1. Fetches data from a GitHub repository.
  2. Preprocesses the data to extract relevant text.
  3. Converts the text into a format suitable for a local LLM.
  4. Uses Ollama and Deepseek to process the data locally.
