### A Feature Engineering Tutorial for Real Estate Data: From Feature Creation to Insights

Feature engineering is one of the most critical steps in building effective machine learning models. It involves creating, manipulating, and selecting relevant features from raw data to improve model performance and reduce complexity. In the following,

The proposed feature engineering process is demonstrated using a synthesized real estate dataset. Two unsupervised learning algorithms, K-means and hierarchical clustering, are applied to group similar synthetic observations (data items) and extract insights from the dataset.

This tutorial is designed for beginners and is perfect for an academic class setting or anyone looking to understand the basics of feature engineering. Letâ€™s dive in!
