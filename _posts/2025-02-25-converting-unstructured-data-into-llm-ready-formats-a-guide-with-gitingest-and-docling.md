Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and others have revolutionized how we interact with and process data. However, one of the biggest challenges in leveraging LLMs effectively is preparing unstructured or semi-structured data in a format these models can understand. Whether itâ€™s a GitHub repository full of code or a collection of PDFs and DOCX files, converting such data into LLM-ready formats can be time-consuming and complex.

Fortunately, open-source tools like **Gitingest** and **Docling** are here to simplify this process. This article is a continuing effort of a series of articles about how you can transform your data into LLM-friendly formats with minimal effort.
